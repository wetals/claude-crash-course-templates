I'm creating a next JS project and I need your help turning my drawings into real life next JS code. 
Just to give you a little bit more background about the project. 
I am trying to automate my workflow with the help of AI so that I can upload video clips, 
and then configure some prompts and then trigger a bunch of Lang chain runs to go off and 
summarize all of my YouTube videos and generate post for LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and a bunch more places.

I'm uploading pictures of a few key wireframes of the app.

Upload Wireframes - Maximum 5

You now know enough, please generate the masterplan.md file

STEP 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new Claude project: "Youtube Content Automation"
2. Add generated masterplan.md to Project Knowledge
3. Add wireframes (content)
4. Add Prompt from the FILE: "2_stub_out_project.txt" (remember to specify typescript)


STEP 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Add all the files into the "Project Knowledge"
2. Add Prompt from the FILE: "3_fully_code_out_implementation.txt" 

The first page I need help with is the root page `app/page.tsx`. Currently, this page is very bland.
I would like you to make this page look modern and stylish. Add a hero section to greet the user,
let them know about the app and then have a CTA which directs them to their projects. 
For the color scheme, I want to use rose-500, dark gray and white.
